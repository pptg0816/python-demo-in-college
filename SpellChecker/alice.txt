You seem very clever at explaining words Sir said Alice Would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called Jabberwocky
Lets hear it said Humpty Dumpty I can explain all the poems that were ever invented and a good many that haven't been invented just yet
This sounded very hopeful so Alice repeated the first verse
Twas brillig and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe
